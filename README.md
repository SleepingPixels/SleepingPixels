## A little bit about me...
Hi, I'm Jess. 
I was born in the 80s and grew up in the 90s, so I love all the nostalgia that brings.
I create pixel art and turn it into stuff. I'm inspired by retro indie games, nostalgia, and cozy, wholesome vibes. 🎮✨ 
I also really enjoy problem-solving and coding in pretty themes. 
I’m a socially awkward, neurodivergent soul who loves nothing more than curling up in an oversized hoodie with a cup of French Earl Grey tea. 
Most days, I’m in my home studio making pixel art, studying code and listening to music.
