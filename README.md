## A little bit about me...
Hi, my name is Jess. I was born in the 80s and grew up in the 90s in Australia. I love creating pixel art and turning it into stuff. I'm inspired by retro indie games, nostalgia, and cozy, wholesome vibes. 🎮✨ I also really enjoy problem-solving and dabbling in coding. I’m a socially awkward, neurodivergent soul who loves nothing more than curling up in my oversized hoodie, with a cup of French Earl Grey tea (and forget to drink). Most days, I’m in my home studio making pixel art, studying code and listening to music.
