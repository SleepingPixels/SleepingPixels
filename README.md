### A little bit about me...
Hi, I'm Jess. 
I was born in the 80s and grew up in the 90s, I love all things retro and nostalgia.
I create pixel art and turn it into things like cross-stitch patterns. I'm inspired by lo-fi music, games, and enjoy cozy, wholesome vibes. üéÆ‚ú® <br/>
<br/>I also enjoy problem-solving and tinkering with code. I am working towards changing careers into web development to eventually design and build websites for a living, which is something I wish I had done 10 years ago... but here we are. <br/>
<br/>I‚Äôm a socially awkward, neurodivergent soul, curled up in an oversized hoodie tinkering with my tech and sippin' a cup of coffee.
